<h1>CAFE LATTE</h1>
<hr>

<p>
A latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.

The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffè latte [kafˈfɛ ˈlatte], caffelatte [kaffeˈlatte] or caffellatte [kaffelˈlatte], which means "milk coffee". The word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography.
